Abstract
========
This APE defines the formal fundamental governance process for the Astropy Project. The Astropy Project broadly follows the philosophy of do-ocracy: project participants who 
gain experience and knowledge through sustained community contributions and have demonstrated adherence to core principles of inclusion and consensus-building will be entrusted 
with increasing levels of authority. This peaks with the Coordination Commitee, which has relatively broad authority but seeks to exercise it as rarely as possible by working towards consensus. This is because at its core, the Project is both by and for its community, and therefore it is the final source of authority and direction. 

Detailed Description
====================
The {bylaws-not-bylaws} are described in this section. The initial version is the outcome of several months of discussion by the Astropy Governance Working Group, which aimed to both codify existing informal governance rules as well as update them with new ideas that are consistent with the philosophy of and vision for the Astropy project.

Ultimate Authority: The Astropy Community
-----------------------------------------
The Astropy Project derives its authority from the whole community - developers, users, and even potential participants in the broader astronomical and scientific software 
community. All have a vested interest in the success of the Project, so all governance in the end belongs to this community in its entirety. The {bylaws-not-bylaws} described 
below provide levels of delegation of that authority, particularly to the Voting Members and the Coordination Committee. 

The Coordination Committee
--------------------------

Composition
^^^^^^^^^^^
The Coordination Committee is a committee that is composed of four members. To represent a broad set of interests, the Coordination Committee should have no more than two 
members from a particular employer. The Ombudsperson (described in Section 4)  and the Coordination Committee will work to maintain this composition following the processes 
laid out in these {bylaws-not-bylaws}.

Role
^^^^^^^
The Coordination Committee’s role is to facilitate consensus in the Project and coordinate Project-spanning efforts.  As such, the Coordination Committee shall work to:

* Maintain the quality and stability of the Astropy ecosystem of packages for the community,
* Facilitate the development of resources that improve accessibility and understanding of the Astropy ecosystem,
* Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible,
* Oversee the financial and legal status of the project,
* Lead and oversee the decision-making process for APEs and other community decisions,
* Seek consensus among the Astropy community, particularly before acting in a formal capacity,
* Act as the decision-making body where all other methods for achieving consensus have failed,
* Operate openly and provide transparency and opportunity for community input into its activities.

Powers
^^^^^^
The Coordination Committee has broad authority to make decisions about the Project. For example, they can:

* Accept or reject APEs;
* Enforce or update the Project's code of conduct
* Manage any project assets (including financial and physical assets)
* Delegate parts of their authority to other subcommittees or processes

However, they cannot modify the Governance of the Project (i.e., this document), except during the initial adoption of these {bylaws-not-bylaws} as specified herein.

The Coordination Committee has broad authority, which they seek to exercise as rarely as possible by working towards consensus. The Coordination Committee should look for ways 
to use these powers as little as possible, striving to involve the community whenever possible for decisions, and delegating responsibilities.

When delegating its power by creating roles or making appointments the Coordination Committee must solicit community feedback for no less than two weeks.

Making Decisions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use its powers, the Coordination Committee must first attempt to reach a consensus. If a consensus cannot be reached the Committee votes. Every Coordination Committee member 
must either vote or explicitly abstain. Members with a conflict of interest on a particular vote must abstain. The final decision regarding what constitutes a conflict of 
interest is determined by the Ombudsperson in accordance with the conflict of interest policy. Passing decisions require a strict majority of non-abstaining Coordination 
Committee members.

Whenever possible, the Coordination Committee's deliberations shall be held in public in a manner that permits discussion and comments from the community. Final decisions made 
by the Coordination Committee will be published in a publicly visible location.

Electing the Coordination Committee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A Coordination Committee election is held annually to fill any vacant seats. Notice of the election must be posted via the Project’s standard communication channels (reaching 
all active s) at least one month before the election begins.  The election consists of two phases, each lasting two weeks:

* Phase 1, Nominations: Candidates will be nominated and confirm their interest in serving. Candidates can be nominated by anyone, including themselves, and do not have to be  
  Voting Members to be nominated. 
* Phase 2, Voting: Each Voting Member can vote for zero or more of the candidates, up to the number of candidates. Voting is performed anonymously. Candidates are ranked by the 
  total number of votes they receive. If a tie occurs, it may be resolved by mutual agreement among the candidates, or else the winner will be chosen at random.

The election process is managed by a non-voting Returns Officer nominated by the outgoing Coordination Committee. For the initial election, the Returns Officer will be 
nominated by the NumFOCUS Executive officer or their delegate. Elections will be carried out every year, provided that at least one of the Coordination Committee members has 
reached the end of their term or decided to step down.

Term
^^^^
Each Coordination Committee member's term runs for three years from when the election results are finalized, except when the election was to fill a vacancy created partway 
through a term. In that case, the newly-elected member’s term runs for the remainder of the term of the person they are replacing. There is no limit to the number of terms that 
a single individual can be elected for.

For the initial election of Coordination Committee members, two seats will have terms of one year, one has a term of two years, and one has a term of three years to create a 
staggered set of replacements and provide continuity in the Coordination Committee.

Vacancies
^^^^^^^^^
Coordination Committee members may resign their position at any time.

Whenever there is a vacancy during the regular Coordination Committee term an election must take place.

If a Coordination Committee member cannot be contacted for longer than two months without prior notification (for example, due to planned leave), then the rest of the 
Coordination Committee may vote to trigger an election to replace them for the duration of their term.

Removing Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In exceptional circumstances, the Voting Members may remove one or more sitting Coordination Committee members via a single vote.

Such a vote is triggered when a Voting Member calls for one publicly on an appropriate Project-wide communication channel, and two other active Voting Members second the 
proposal.

For Coordination Committee Member(s) to be removed, 2/3 of the active Voting Members must vote in support of the removal.

To avoid repeated removal votes, any individual Voting Member who has called for, or seconded such a vote, may not call for or second a vote to remove any other Coordination 
Committee member for one year from the original motion.

The Ombudsperson
----------------
The Ombudsperson represents the interests of the Astropy community by providing an alternative point of contact for sensitive issues such as code of conduct violations and 
ethical concerns. Candidates for this project role are publicly nominated by the Coordination Committee, after which the Coordination Committee allows at least 2 weeks for 
comment, and then the nominee must be confirmed by ⅔ of the active Voting Members.  

The Ombudsperson has no term limit but can resign at any time, or be removed by the same process as being confirmed: the Coordination Committee initiates, there is a two-week 
comment period, and ⅔ of the active Voting Members have to approve the removal. In the period between removal/resignation and new appointment, the Coordination Committee will 
temporarily take over the responsibilities of the Ombudsperson, should the need arise.

The Voting Members
------------------

Role
^^^^
The Voting Members are the group of trusted individuals who operate the Astropy Project on behalf of the community.  They have authority over the Astropy Project’s technical 
resources, including the Astropy Project website itself, the Astropy GitHub organization and repositories, the issue tracker, and all Astropy communication channels. In 
practice, much of this authority is passed to the Coordination Committee via the voting processes described in these {bylaws-not-bylaws}.

They also assume many roles required to achieve the Project's goals, especially those that require a high level of trust. Collectively, they make decisions that shape the 
future of the Project.  

Voting Members are expected to act as role models for the community and custodians of the Project, on behalf of the community and all those who rely on Astropy. They will act 
as representatives of the Astropy Project, where necessary, including in online discussions or at official Astropy events.

Powers
^^^^^^
Voting Members may participate in formal votes on:
* adding new Voting Members,
* removing Voting Members,
* electing Coordination Committee members,
* removing Coordination Committee members,
* appointment or removal of the Ombudsperson,
* changes to these {bylaws-not-bylaws},
* other matters for which the Coordination Committee believes a vote is appropriate.

The mechanism, timeline, and criteria for a decisive  vote are specified in the respective sections of this document in the first six cases and by the Coordination Committee in 
the last case.

Membership
^^^^^^^^^^
Voting Members of the Astropy Project must demonstrate:
* a good grasp of the philosophy of the Astropy Project,
* a solid track record of being constructive and helpful,
* significant contributions to the Project's goals, in any form,
* a willingness to dedicate time to improving the Project,
* a willingness to recruit, train, and nominate new team members.

Voting Membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align well with the philosophy and the goals of the Astropy Project.

Initial Membership
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anyone who satisfies any of the following criteria will be invited to be in the first group of Voting Members: 

* has a named role in the project and has participated in an Astropy coordination meeting in the last two years, 
* has a named role in the project and has regularly participated in Astropy telecons (e.g., co-working telecon, spectroscopy sprint, Astropy Learn telecon) in the last two   
  years, 
* has commit rights to at least one repository in the astropy GitHub organization and has actively used those commit rights in the last two years.

Add New Voting Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anyone can apply to become a Voting Member by providing evidence of meeting the requirements laid out in the Membership section above. Both self-nominations and nominations by 
others are allowed. The Voting Members are expected to make their decisions based on the candidate’s adherence to the membership criteria, above. The name of the nominee will 
be known to Voting Members but will not be shared outside Voting Members and the Coordination Committee unless the nominee becomes a Voting Member.

The procedure for voting to add new Voting Members is:

* The Coordination Committee and Ombudsperson receive each nomination, check that it is factually accurate, that the nominated person accepts the nomination, and that their 
  record of community activity adheres to the Code of Conduct.
* Once a nomination is accepted by the Coordination Committee, the Coordination Committee will initiate a vote among active Voting Members. The voting will be open for at least 
  two weeks and will conclude within four weeks of the nomination being accepted. To successfully gain an appointment as a Voting Member, the nominee must receive at least four 
  positive votes, as long as that constitutes a majority of those voting. 
* The candidate will be informed promptly at the close of voting by a Coordination Committee member. If the vote is not affirmative, the Coordination Committee will provide 
  feedback to the nominee.

Term and Active/Inactive Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Voting Members have no term or term limits. Voting Members who have stopped contributing are encouraged to declare themselves as "inactive.” Those who have not made any 
significant contribution for a long period may be asked to move themselves to the “inactive”  category by the Coordination Committee. If no response is received, the 
Coordination Committee may automatically change a Voting Member’s status to inactive. To record and honor their contributions, inactive Voting Members will continue to be 
listed. Inactive Voting Members are not able to participate in votes.

Removing Voting Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Voting Members against their will. A vote must be held to remove a Voting Member. Such a vote is 
triggered by a motion made by an active Voting Member, which must be seconded by an additional Voting Member. The vote must conclude  no more than four weeks after the motion 
is seconded. Removal requires approval by ⅔ of all active Voting Members at the time the motion is made. The motion, second, and vote will be held in private. Removal under 
this provision will be reflected by updating the list of Voting Members. 

It may be necessary for the Ombudsperson and the Coordination Committee to remove a Voting Member for violations of the Code of Conduct. In this case, the Coordination 
Committee and Ombudsperson will work together to make this decision. 

Approving and Modifying These {bylaws-not-bylaws}
-------------------------------------------------
This document was submitted following the process in APE 1, and the normal APE acceptance procedures will be followed. The Coordination Committee at the time of submitting this 
APE are all co-authors and therefore will not override any consensus of the community on accepting the final version.

Changes to these {bylaws-not-bylaws} after they have been accepted should follow the modification process in APE 1, with the exception that the final approval of the modification requires 
approval by a ⅔ vote of the Voting Members rather than approval by the Coordination Committee. 

Attribution and Acknowledgements
--------------------------------
The format and some of the structures outlined in this document are heavily inspired by the Python Language Governance structure (`PEP13 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-
0013/>`_), the YT Project's Team Infrastructure (`YTEP 1776 <https://ytep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/YTEPs/YTEP-1776.html>`_), and earlier less-formal descriptions of the Astropy 
governance.

Branches and Pull Requests
==========================
N/A

Implementation
==============
These {bylaws-not-bylaws} enter into force upon this APE being accepted (see the last section of the description).  At that time the ``GOVERNANCE.md`` file in the astropy repo should be 
updated to point to this document.

Backward Compatibility
======================
These {bylaws-not-bylaws} supercede previous un-codified governance understandings, but do not serve to invalidate the APE process or any other processes or policies that pre-date it and 
do not conflict.

Alternatives
============
The Astropy Governance Working Group discussed a wide range of alternatives on both the broad scope of Project governance and details of these {bylaws-not-bylaws}.  It is not practical to 
summarize that in the text of this APE, but the Working Group's running notes provide an excellent starting point for this discussion.

Decision rationale
